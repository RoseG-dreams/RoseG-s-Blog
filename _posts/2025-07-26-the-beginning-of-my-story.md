*This blog will carry my dreams-woven from quite hopes, patient hands, and days no one ever saw.*

## Who am I and what am I going to do?

Hello! If you don't know I'm Rose or some people call me Gulsum. This is my first Blog!

Today I'm going to tell you my project. First of all let's talk about 'Why am I here? What is my purpose?' 

I am a highschool student who dreams of becoming a Robotics Engineer. And this page will carry my dreams, hopes, wishes and maybe more. I am writing  this blog to record what I've done, how far I've come, and what the process has been like as I grow and improve.

Currently I'm working on a project that I believe will help me grow a lot. It's about writing an essay and then trying to solve the problem discussed in the essay using my knowledge of Robotic.

Two days ago I started to write and finished the first title!

I am writing about Climate Change and Global Warming, which are having deadly effects on our Planet and, of course, on our lives, our future, and on humanity itself.

People must be aware of Climate Change, but they are still making same mistakes. As someone living on this planet, I must also be aware and responsibility. I want to understand this problem deeply, gain knowledge, and try to help even in small ways.

And now... here I am.
